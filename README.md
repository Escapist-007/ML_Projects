**Problem:** 
The project is about different classification and regression techniques. There are six sub-problems under this project.
- Experiment with `Gaussian Discriminators` by implementing Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
- Linear Regression implementation
- Experiment with Ridge Regression
- Using Gradient Descent for Ridge Regression
- Non-linear Regression
- Compare and interpret the results of different classification and regression methods

### [Project_02](Project_02) :
<img src="images/bar.jpg" alt="bar.jpg" width="1100" height="3"> <br>

**Problem:** 
Handwritten Digits Classification using **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network**

**Approach:**
- Implement MLP Neural Network from scratch without to classify handwritten digits from MNIST dataset
- Use Feed Forward, Back Propagation to implement Neural Network
- Experiment the effect of `regularization` in the `bias-variance` trade-off
- Use the same neural network for more challenging face dataset and compared it with `Deep Neural Network` and `Convolutional Neural Network` using the Tensorflow library
